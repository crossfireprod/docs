  Calibrating Backlash Compensation
---

Now we can have OpenPnP run its automatic backlash compensation routine to make all head movements more accurate.

1. First, we'll select the axis we want to calibrate backlash compensation for. Under the `Machine Setup` tab, select `ReferenceControllerAxis x` under `Axis`. Then select the `Backlash Compensation` tab.

2. Next, click the `Calibrate now` button. The machine will go through a long routine (between 5-15 minutes) where it measures the machine's backlash, and determines the best settings to account for it.

3. When it's done, you'll see the output data from the calibration. We suggest selecting `OneSidedOptimizedPositioning` for the Compensation Method, but experiment with the different options to see which gives you the best results.

4. Perform steps 1 - 3 but with the Y axis instead.
