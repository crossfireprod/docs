## **What you'll learn**

This guide is focused on performing basic calibration for your LumenPnP.

## **What you'll need**

- A LumenPnP with the mechanical and electrical build completed.
- Read through the [OpenPnP Wiki](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/User-Manual). It'll be super important to getting going with your machine. **These docs are meant to augment the OpenPnP docs, not replace them.**
